# GhostPE

**GhostPE** is an in-memory Portable Executable (PE) loader written in Rust. It demonstrates how to manually map and execute Windows PE files (EXEs and DLLs) without touching diskâ€”a technique often used in offensive security and red team engagements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Learn Windows PE internals by implementing a loader from scratch
- Understand how manual mapping bypasses traditional file-based detection
- Build foundational skills for developing advanced techniques:
    - Reflective DLL injection
    - Process hollowing
    - EDR evasion

## ðŸš€ Features (Planned)

- PE file parsing (DOS header, NT headers, section headers)
- Memory allocation and section mapping
- Relocation handling
- Import table resolution
- Entry point execution
